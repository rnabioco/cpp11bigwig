# cpp11bigwig (development version)

# cpp11bigwig 0.1.0

* Initial CRAN submission.

# cpp11bigwig 0.0.0.9000

* libBigWig is mostly untouched excpect for removal of `fprintf` statements (which R won't allow in linked libraries) and fixups for ASAN errors, mostly GNU-specific pointer arithmetic. cpp11bigwig passes both ASAN and valgrind checks (via rhub).
