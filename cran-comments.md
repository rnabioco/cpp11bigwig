* This is a patch release to correct an issue with coordinate parsing.

* The rchk issue in the cpp11bigwig CRAN checks will be resolved upstream in cpp11 <https://github.com/r-lib/cpp11/issues/408> and also affects other packages using cpp11 (e.g. cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_tweenr.html).
